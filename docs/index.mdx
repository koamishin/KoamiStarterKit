# Project Overview

**KoamiStarterKit** is an opinionated, production-ready starter kit for modern Laravel applications. It bridges the gap between rapid development and enterprise-grade architecture by providing a fully configured environment with "batteries included" but without the bloat.

## Core Problem Solved

It eliminates the repetitive setup phase of integrating a modern frontend (Vue 3, Inertia, Tailwind) with a robust backend (Laravel 12, Fortify, Filament), allowing developers to ship features immediately.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Frontend Architecture:** Seamlessly integrates a Vue 3 + Inertia.js user-facing app with a Filament v5 admin panel.
- **Complete Authentication:** Pre-configured Fortify implementation (2FA, Email Verification, Profile Management).
- **Type-Safe Routing:** Integrated **Wayfinder** for robust, type-safe route generation in TypeScript.
- **Developer Experience:** Optimized with Laravel Octane, Docker, and a custom setup wizard.
- **Quality Assurance:** Pre-configured with Pint (linting), PHPStan (static analysis), and Rector (refactoring).
