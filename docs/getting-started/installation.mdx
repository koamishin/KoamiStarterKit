# Setup & Installation

KoamiStarterKit is designed to be flexible. You can install it using the method that best fits your workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **PHP 8.2+** (with extensions: `ctype`, `curl`, `dom`, `fileinfo`, `filter`, `hash`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `pcre`, `pdo`, `session`, `tokenizer`, `xml`)
- **Composer** (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- **Node.js & NPM** (LTS version recommended)
- **Docker** (Optional, but recommended for local services like Redis/Postgres)

---

## Method 1: The Laravel Installer (Recommended)

The easiest way to start is using the official Laravel CLI. This feels native to the ecosystem.

### 1. Install the Laravel Installer

If you haven't already:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

### 2. Create a New Project

Use the `--using` flag to scaffold your app directly from the starter kit repository:

```bash
laravel new my-app --using=koamishin/koamistarterkit
```

### 3. Enter the Directory

```bash
cd my-app
```

### 4. Run the Setup Wizard

We have a custom Artisan command to personalize the kit for you:

```bash
php artisan setup:starter-kit
```

---

## Method 2: Composer Create-Project

If you prefer using Composer directly without the global Laravel installer:

### 1. Run Create Project

```bash
composer create-project koamishin/koamistarterkit my-app
```

### 2. Enter Directory & Setup

```bash
cd my-app
php artisan setup:starter-kit
```

---

## Method 3: Manual Installation (Git Clone)

For contributors or those who want full control over the initialization process.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koamishin/KoamiStarterKit.git my-app
cd my-app
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate your application encryption key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 4. Database Setup

By default, the project is configured for **SQLite**. Create the database file:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

_If you prefer MySQL or PostgreSQL, update `DB_CONNECTION` in your `.env` file._

Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 5. Install Node Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 6. Run the Setup Wizard

Finalize the configuration:

```bash
php artisan setup:starter-kit
```

---

## Post-Installation Steps

Regardless of the method you chose, once installed, you can start the development server.

### Start Development Server

This command runs the Laravel backend, Vite frontend server, Queue worker, and Pail (logger) concurrently:

```bash
composer run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Verify Installation

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the test suite:

```bash
composer test
```
