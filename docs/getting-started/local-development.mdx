# Local Development

KoamiStarterKit is optimized for a seamless local development experience. Once you have installed the project, getting up and running is designed to be a single command.

## The "One Command" Start

Instead of running separate terminal tabs for your backend, frontend, queues, and logs, we provide a unified command using `concurrently`.

```bash
composer run dev
```

This single command automatically starts the following services in parallel:

1.  **Laravel Server:** `php artisan serve` (Backend)
2.  **Vite:** `npm run dev` (Frontend with HMR)
3.  **Queue Worker:** `php artisan queue:listen` (Background jobs)
4.  **Pail:** `php artisan pail` (Real-time application logs)

> **Note:** Access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Database Management

### Default: SQLite

By default, the starter kit is configured to use **SQLite**.

- **Zero Config:** No external database server required.
- **File Location:** `database/database.sqlite`.
- **GUI:** We recommend using a tool like **TablePlus** or **DB Browser for SQLite** to inspect your data.

### Switching to MySQL/PostgreSQL

If you prefer a more robust database for development (or to match production):

1.  **Update `.env`:**
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=my_app
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```
2.  **Laravel Sail (Docker):**
    Since `laravel/sail` is included in the dev dependencies, you can easily scaffold a Docker environment:
    ```bash
    php artisan sail:install
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
    ```

## Tooling & IDE Setup

To get the best experience (especially with Vue 3 and Tailwind), we strongly recommend **VS Code** with the following extensions:

### Recommended Extensions

- **Vue - Official (Volar):** Essential for Vue 3 SFC support.
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense:** Autocomplete for Tailwind classes.
- **PHP Intelephense:** Better PHP code intelligence.
- **ESLint:** Real-time linting for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Prettier:** Automatic code formatting.

### VS Code Settings

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file to ensure consistent formatting on save:

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
    },
    "[vue]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[php]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client"
    }
}
```

## Debugging

### Real-time Logs (Pail)

Because `composer run dev` starts **Laravel Pail**, you will see application logs (errors, exceptions, `Log::info()`) streaming directly in your terminal window. You don't need to `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`.

### Tinker

For interacting with your application's data and classes via the command line:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Example usage:

```php
> User::factory()->create();
> $user = User::first();
> $user->notify(new WelcomeNotification());
```

## Code Quality Checks

Before pushing code, it's good practice to run the quality suite:

```bash
# Fix code style (PHP)
composer lint

# Analyze types (PHP)
composer phpstan

# Run tests
composer test
```
