# Branding & Customization

KoamiStarterKit is built to be easily rebranded. You can change the application name, logos, and manage visual themes with simple commands and configuration changes.

## Branding

### Application Name

The application name is used in the browser title, emails, and parts of the UI.
Update it in your `.env` file:

```env
APP_NAME="My Awesome App"
```

### Logos & Icons

The project separates the logo logic into two Vue components found in `resources/js/components/`:

1.  **`KoamishinLogo.vue`:** This is the SVG icon. Replace the `<svg>...</svg>` content with your own brand mark.
2.  **`AppLogo.vue`:** This is the full logo (Icon + Text) used in the sidebar and auth pages. It imports `KoamishinLogo` and adds the text "Koamishin Starterkit". You should update the text here to match your brand.

### Favicon

Replace the `public/favicon.ico` file with your own favicon.

## Theming

The starter kit uses a powerful theming system compatible with **Shadcn** and **Tailwind CSS v4**. Themes are CSS files stored in `resources/css/themes/`.

### Managing Themes

We provide a set of Artisan commands to manage your themes easily.

#### 1. Import a Theme

You can import any theme from the [tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com) theme generator. Copy the "Export JSON" URL and run:

```bash
php artisan theme:import https://tweakcn.com/api/themes/your-theme-id
```

This will:

- Download the theme definition.
- Generate a CSS file in `resources/css/themes/`.
- Automatically register it in `resources/js/conf/themes.ts`.
- Make it available in the **Theme Switcher** UI immediately.

#### 2. Add a Theme Manually

If you have a local theme definition or want to create one from scratch:

```bash
php artisan theme:add my-custom-theme
```

#### 3. Remove a Theme

To delete a theme and remove it from the configuration:

```bash
php artisan theme:remove ocean
```

### Admin Panel (Filament)

The admin panel has its own separate theme configuration located at `resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`.
To customize the admin panel colors, you can modify the `AdminPanelProvider` or the CSS file directly.

## UI Components

The project uses **Shadcn Vue** components. These are not installed via npm but are "copy-pasted" into your project, giving you full control over their code.
You can find them in `resources/js/components/ui/`. Feel free to modify them to fit your design system requirements.
