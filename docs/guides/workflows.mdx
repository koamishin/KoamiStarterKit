# Workflows

## Development Loop

The project uses `concurrently` (via `composer run dev`) to manage the dev stack.

1.  **Laravel Server:** Serves the backend and API.
2.  **Vite:** Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for Vue components.
3.  **Queue:** Processes background jobs (emails, etc.).
4.  **Pail:** Streams logs to your terminal.

## Authentication Flow (Fortify)

1.  **Login:** Request to `/login` -> Fortify Action -> Authenticate Session.
2.  **2FA:** If enabled, Fortify interrupts flow -> User enters OTP -> Session Fully Authenticated.
3.  **Redirect:** User sent to `RouteServiceProvider::HOME` (usually `/dashboard`).
