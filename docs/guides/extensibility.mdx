# Extensibility

## Adding UI Components

The project uses **Shadcn Vue**. To add new components:

1.  Ideally, use the `shadcn-vue` CLI (if configured) or manually copy component code into `resources/js/components/ui`.
2.  Import them in your pages: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`.

## Adding Admin Resources

To add a new CRUD section to the admin panel:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Post
```

This generates the Resource, Table, and Form classes in `app/Filament/Resources`.
