# Security Considerations

## Authentication

Strictly handled by **Laravel Fortify**. Do not manually implement login controllers unless necessary.

## Authorization

Use **Spatie Permissions**.

- `@can('edit posts')` in Blade.
- `v-if="$page.props.auth.can['edit posts']"` in Vue (requires prop sharing).

## Impersonation Risks

Impersonation is a sensitive feature. It is restricted to users with the `super_admin` role (or equivalent permission) within the `UserResource`.
