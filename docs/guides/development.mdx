# Development Guide

## Coding Conventions

- **Linting:** Run `composer lint` (uses Laravel Pint) before committing.
- **Static Analysis:** Run `composer phpstan` to catch type errors.
- **Refactoring:** Run `composer rector` to apply automated modernizations.

## Testing

The project uses **Pest PHP** for testing.

- **Run All Tests:** `composer test`
- **Unit Tests:** `php artisan test --unit`
- **Feature Tests:** `php artisan test`

## Debugging

- **Tinker:** `php artisan tinker` for REPL access to your models.
- **Browser Logs:** `php artisan pail` streams logs directly to your CLI during `composer run dev`.
